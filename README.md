# Snake
An OOP implementation of Snake playable in the browser.

This was a simple project I made over the course of a few hours in order to teach myself the basics of JavaScript.
It is fully functional and is inspired by the retro versions of snake, rather than the new versions with smooth movement and fancier graphics (e.g Google Snake).
