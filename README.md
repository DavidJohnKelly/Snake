# Snake
## _An OOP implementation of Snake playable in the browser_

This was a simple project I made over the course of a few hours in order to teach myself the basics of JavaScript.
It is fully functional and is inspired by the retro versions of snake, rather than the new versions with smooth movement and fancier graphics (e.g Google Snake).

## Features

- A fully featured playable game of snake with score counting and size adjusting
- Rather than dying when you reach the screen edge, you will instead be wrapped around to the approprate opposing edge. This allows for some interesting gameplay scenarios.
- The screen size can be resized whenever and the snake bounds and apple spawning locations will adjust appropriately

You can [play the game here](https://davidjohnkelly.github.io/Snake/).
